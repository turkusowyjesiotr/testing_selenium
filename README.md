# test automation on seleniumdemo.com webpage


This is my test automation project done on dummy website http://seleniumdemo.com with **Python**. I used **Selenium** and **Page Object Model** design pattern to perform 
few tests: logging in (with valid and invalid credentials), creating new account (with already registered e-mail and a new one) and logging into account and changing billing address information linked to it.
Tests were perfomed using **pytest** module and I also used **Allure** to generate test report.


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.7
- Selenium 4.4.0
- pytest 7.1.2
- Allure 2.18.1
